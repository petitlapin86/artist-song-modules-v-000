#The "your-name" part of the above URL might be referred to as a slug.
# Another term for this section of a URL is "parameter" or "param". 
 #One common task you'll undertake as a web developer is to take a Ruby object, 
 #such as an instance of a User class, and make a URL out of it. For example, 
 #let's say we have a database full of instances of a User class. 
 #When an individual user signs in to our app, we might want to show 
 #them their very own profile page. To do so, we would have to write 
#a method that takes their name and turns it into a slug or parameter 
#that could be tacked onto a URL.
